- Git or other VCSs are great tools for safe coding as well as collaboration
- Github is pretty awesome
- Should personalize my terminal more

1. Get more familiar with git and common practices
2. Become more proficient in using a calendar to manage time throughout the week

* Shoutout to my other half Victoria for always being a helpful resource and super supportive
